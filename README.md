## The Problem We Solve

Teachers in schools, coaching centres, and colleges often face an overwhelming workload, particularly when it comes to providing individualized feedback to students in large classrooms. The manual processes of grading assignments and creating tests are incredibly time-consuming, leaving educators with limited bandwidth to focus on actual teaching, mentoring, and personalized student interaction.

This challenge is especially acute in under-resourced educational settings where high teacher-to-student ratios are common. Consequently, students often miss out on the personalized guidance and timely feedback crucial for their academic development and success. This administrative burden contributes significantly to teacher burnout and impacts the quality of education.

## Our Solution: Assessly

Assessly tackles these challenges head-on by offering a platform that leverages AI to automate and streamline key pedagogical tasks.

Our core functionalities include:

1.  **Automated Assignment & Test Grading:** Utilizing AI (powered by Gemini API), Assessly can evaluate student submissions, including **handwritten answers** processed via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It provides instantaneous grading and personalized, constructive feedback for each student.
2.  **Automated Test Generation:** Teachers can generate customized online tests quickly based on specified topics or subjects, again with support for questions that might involve OCR for answer evaluation later.

By automating these intensive tasks, Assessly frees up teachers to focus on what they do best: teaching, mentoring, and fostering student growth.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm/yarn installed
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud like MongoDB Atlas)
*   Google Gemini API Key

**Backend Setup:**

1.  Navigate to the `Server` directory: `cd Server`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `Server` directory and add your environment variables (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`). Refer to `Server/src/Config/config.ts` potentially for required variables.
4.  Compile TypeScript: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
5.  Start the server: `npm start` or `yarn start` (or use `npm run dev`/`yarn dev` for development mode if configured)

**Frontend Setup:**

1.  Navigate to the `Client` directory: `cd ../Client`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `Client` directory if needed for environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointing to your backend server).
4.  Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).
